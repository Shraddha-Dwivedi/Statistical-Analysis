# Statistical Analysis – Project Overview

This section of the project focuses purely on **statistical analysis** to uncover patterns, trends, and relationships between variables.

The main objective is to apply fundamental statistical techniques to gain a deeper understanding of the data in a structured and meaningful way.

### 1. Data Understanding

* Reviewed dataset structure and variable types
* Identified numerical and categorical features
* Checked for missing and inconsistent values

### 2. Descriptive Statistics

* Calculated key metrics such as:

  * Mean
  * Median
  * Mode
  * Variance
  * Standard Deviation
  * Minimum & Maximum values
* Used these measures to understand the central tendency and spread of data

### 3. Distribution Analysis

* Studied the distribution of important numerical variables
* Identified skewness and spread through graphical and numerical methods
* Observed patterns such as symmetry, skewness, and clustering

### 4. Outlier Detection

* Detected unusual or extreme values that significantly deviate from the rest of the data
* Used statistical methods such as the Interquartile Range (IQR)
* Compared results before and after handling outliers

### 5. Correlation Analysis

* Measured relationships between key numerical variables
* Identified positive, negative, and weak correlations
* Interpreted how one variable may influence another

### 6. Hypothesis Testing

* Formulated null and alternative hypotheses where relevant
* Performed statistical tests to support or reject assumptions
* Drew conclusions based on the test results


##  Summary of Insights

* The data shows clear variation in multiple numeric features.
* Certain variables demonstrate a strong correlation with each other.
* The presence of outliers significantly impacts overall data interpretation.
* Statistical analysis provided valuable insights for potential model building and business decision-making.


This analysis strengthens the foundation for:

* Further predictive modeling
* Feature selection
* Informed decision-making
* Real-world data problem-solving
